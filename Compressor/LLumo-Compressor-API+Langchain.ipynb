In this guide, we will demonstrate how to efficiently incorporate the LLUMO Compressor API into your Langchain pipeline to save costs while utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, we will walk you through the process of extracting answers from a PDF document by integrating Langchain for vector search, OpenAI for generating answers, and LLUMO to compress prompts before sending them to OpenAI.\n","\n","## What You'll Learn\n","\n","1. **Langchain Integration**: How to use Langchain for efficient vector search to locate relevant text passages within a PDF document.\n","2. **OpenAI Integration**: How to utilize OpenAI's LLM for generating answers based on the extracted text passages.\n","3. **LLUMO Compressor API**: How to integrate the LLUMO Compressor API into your pipeline to compress prompts, reducing the amount of data sent to OpenAI and thus saving on API usage costs.\n","\n","## Why This Tutorial?\n","\n","Using LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-4 can be expensive, especially when dealing with large documents or frequent queries. The LLUMO Compressor API helps mitigate these costs by compressing prompts before they are sent to the LLM, ensuring you get the same high-quality responses at a lower cost. This tutorial is particularly useful for developers and data scientists who want to optimize their Langchain pipelines by incorporating cost-saving measures without compromising on performance.\n","\n","By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional pipeline that efficiently extracts and processes information from PDFs, providing accurate answers while minimizing costs through prompt compression.\n","\n","Let's get started!"],"metadata":{"id":"UWJknX9YAKhu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Q_zAm2ZcVABy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Step 1: Installing Required Python Libraries\n","\n","In this first step, we will install several essential Python libraries that are required to build our Langchain pipeline with the LLUMO Compressor API. Each library serves a specific purpose in our workflow, enabling us to handle natural language processing, PDF reading, environment variable management, similarity search, and interaction with OpenAI's API. Here's a detailed overview of each library we will be using:\n","\n","1. **Langchain**: This library and its components provide a robust framework for natural language processing tasks. Langchain offers tools for constructing, training, and deploying language models, making it an integral part of our pipeline for vector search and text processing.\n","\n","2. **PyPDF2**: PyPDF2 is a pure Python library that allows us to read and manipulate PDF files. In this tutorial, we will use PyPDF2 to extract text from PDF documents, which will then be processed and analyzed using our natural language processing tools.\n","\n","3. **python-dotenv**: This library is used for managing environment variables in Python. By using python-dotenv, we can securely store and access sensitive information such as API keys and other configuration settings needed for our project.\n","\n","4. **faiss-cpu**: Developed by Facebook AI Research, faiss-cpu is a powerful library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. We will use faiss-cpu to perform vector search on the text extracted from PDF documents, enabling us to find relevant passages quickly and accurately.\n","\n","5. **openai**: The openai library allows us to interact with OpenAI's API, enabling us to use their powerful language models for generating answers. This library will be crucial for sending prompts and receiving responses from OpenAI's LLM.\n","\n","6. **requests and json**: These libraries are used for making HTTP requests and handling JSON data, respectively. We will use requests to communicate with external APIs, including the LLUMO Compressor API, and json to parse and manipulate JSON data returned by these APIs.\n","\n","Let's start by installing these libraries using the following pip command. This command will ensure that all the necessary libraries are installed and ready to use in our Colab environment."],"metadata":{"id":"dfHCb-hJykxN"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"RoOX9X2bJQTo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725335882738,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":17845,"user":{"displayName":"Jatin
